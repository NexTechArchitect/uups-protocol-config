## 🧠 Overview

This repository contains a **from-scratch UUPS (Universal Upgradeable Proxy Standard) implementation** designed to expose how contract upgradability works internally.

The goal is **not just deployment**, but a deep dive into:
- 📦 **Storage Layout** safety and collision prevention.
- 🔐 **Atomic Upgrades** via `upgradeToAndCall`.
- 🔄 **State Preservation** across V1 → V2 → V3 versions.
- ⛽ **Gas Optimization** compared to Transparent Proxies.
- 🔑 **Access Control** for upgrade authorization.

This project mirrors how **large-scale protocols** manage mutable infrastructure on production networks.

## 📚 What is a UUPS Proxy?

In traditional Ethereum, smart contracts are immutable. **Upgradeable Proxies** separate the **Storage** (State) from the **Logic** (Code), allowing the logic to be swapped while preserving data.

| Feature | Standard Contract | UUPS Upgradeable Proxy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Logic** | Immutable (Forever Fixed) | Swappable (V1 → V2...) |
| **State** | Bound to specific code | Persists in Proxy Address |
| **Gas Cost** | Lower (Direct Call) | Slight Overhead (DelegateCall) |
| **Bug Fixes** | Impossible (Must Redeploy) | Possible (Upgrade Implementation) |

### What does this repo show?
1. Deploying a **V1 Genesis** protocol.
2. Performing a **Pure Logic Upgrade** (V2) adding Pausable functionality.
3. Performing a **Stateful Upgrade** (V3) migrating data structures atomically.

---

## ⚙️ Why UUPS Standard?

UUPS (EIP-1822) is the modern industry standard for upgradability because it is **more gas-efficient** than older Transparent Proxies.

- **Logic in Implementation:** The upgrade mechanism resides in the logic contract, not the proxy.
- **Cheaper Operations:** Removing the `ProxyAdmin` check saves gas on every user transaction.
- **Universal:** Standardized interface compatible with all major tooling (OpenZeppelin, Foundry).

## 🏗️ Architecture & Flow

The flow of a transaction follows the `DelegateCall` pattern, where the Proxy borrows the logic of the Implementation but keeps the state in its own storage.

## 🧩 Key Components

### The Proxy

The `ERC1967Proxy` is the face of the protocol. It holds:

1. **State Variables:** Balances, configurations, and admin roles.
2. **Implementation Address:** Stored in a specific storage slot (EIP-1967) to avoid collisions with state variables.

### Implementation Logic

The `ConfigV` contracts define *how* the state changes.

* **`_authorizeUpgrade`:** A critical security function. In UUPS, the implementation **must** include this function to allow future upgrades. If removed, the proxy becomes permanently locked.

### Storage Gaps

We utilize `uint256[50] __gap` arrays in our contracts.

* **Purpose:** Reserves storage slots for future library upgrades.
* **Mechanism:** Ensures that adding a new variable in a parent contract doesn't shift the storage layout of child contracts, preventing data corruption.

## 🚀 Usage & Scripts

This project uses **Foundry** for all deployments and simulations.

### Prerequisites

* [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Installation

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/NexTechArchitect/uups-protocol-config.git](https://github.com/NexTechArchitect/uups-protocol-config.git)
cd uups-protocol-config
forge install

```

### Build & Test

```bash
forge build
forge test

```

### Deployment & Evolution

We use Solidity scripts to simulate the protocol lifecycle.

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `make deploy` | Deploys the Proxy pointing to V1 Implementation. |
| `make upgrade-v2` | Upgrades logic to V2 (Adds Pausable). |
| `make upgrade-v3` | Upgrades and re-initializes storage for V3. |

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This repository is intended for **educational purposes and architectural exploration**.
While it implements production-grade patterns, upgradeable systems introduce significant complexity. Do not use without a thorough security review and storage layout audit.
